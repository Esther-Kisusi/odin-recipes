# odin-recipes
This is a website I made using HTML, as my first project in The Odin Project course. It contains 3 recipes. Through this project, I excercised several skills such:
-Creating links using anchor tags <a> and </a>
-Appending images through the <img> void element
-Writing ordered and unordered lists.
